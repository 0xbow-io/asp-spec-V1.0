# 1.1 Purpose

```admonish info title='ASP Specification V1.0'
The Association-Set Provider (ASP) Specification V1.0 defines a standardized framework for implementing and
interfacing with protocols for compliance mechanisms.

The ASP system is designed to support compliance mechanisms for blockchain protocols, enabling the verification of compliance
with regulatory requirements and business rules.

The ASP system aims to enable `privacy-preserving compliance` for blockchain protocols,
leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and efficient data categorization techniques.

This document serves to:

1. Provide a comprehensive guide for `integrating protocols`, `feature extractors`, and `end-users` with the ASP system.
2. Establish a `standardized framework` for `building` and `operating` an ASP.
3. Define the `technical specifications` and `interfaces` for each component of the ASP architecture.
4. Outline `best practices` for ensuring `security`, `scalability`, and `privacy` in ASP implementations.
