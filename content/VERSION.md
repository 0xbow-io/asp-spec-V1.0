ASP Spec V1.0 establishes the baseline for future versions. All subsequent minor versions (1.x) will maintain backwards compatibility with V1.0.

ASP Spec follows Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (https://semver.org/). Version numbers are in the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where:

- MAJOR version increments denote incompatible API changes
- MINOR version increments add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
- PATCH version increments make backwards-compatible bug fixes
- PRE-RELEASE versions are denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot-separated identifiers immediately following the PATCH version
