# 5.4 Categorization Best Practices

1. **Simplify Categories**: Excersise a reductionist approach to simplify categories to its most basic form.

2. **Multi-Label Classification**: Allow records to belong to multiple categories simultaneously.

3. **Threshold Scores**: Include threshold scores for each category assignment.

4. **Interpretability**: Well define categories & features to ensure interpretability of the classification results.

5. **Cross-Protocol Consistency**: Ensure consistent categorization across different protocols for similar state transitions.

6. **Version Control**: Maintain strict version control.

7. **Auditability**: Ensure that the categorization process is auditable.

8. **Privacy-Preserving Classification**: Consider using homomorphic encryption or secure multi-party computation for privacy-sensitive features.

9. **Efficient Querying**: Optimise category to record mapping for efficient querying of records based on category criteria.
